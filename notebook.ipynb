       "\"A tomato is a soft-bodied fruit that is usually eaten raw, mashed, cooked or fermented, along with an acidic sauce such as tomato sauce. Many other styles of tomato are added to a standard diet like soy, corn and even olive oil. More recently, a variety of low-calorie soups or pasta sauces are used such as lasagna, and many others. High protein and low calorie substitutes can be found in many foods around the world.\\n\\nSoup making is one of the best ways a human will make their own food.\\n\\nI can't stress all the foods that make my days easy because most people just choose to make their own. As much as one or two recipes can be good and many people think I have the best diet\""
