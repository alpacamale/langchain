It is native to the Andean region of South America and is a major food source worldwide. Potatoes are usually grown as an underground, bulbous structure (the tuber) and are a cool-season crop, with the best yields occurring at cool temperatures between 45-60°F (7-15°C). They are rich in carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin C, and potassium. Potatoes can be prepared and consumed in various ways, such as boiling, baking, frying, or mashing.'"
